\section{\-Class \-List}
\-Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\-:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classGenerator}{\-Generator} \\*\-It contains all the generator threads as its functions }{\pageref{classGenerator}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structGraphNode}{\-Graph\-Node} \\*\-This is the main data structure of the graph generated by the generator threads. \-It contains all the information such as name, department, $\ast$ courses, interests, etc }{\pageref{structGraphNode}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classNetwork}{\-Network} \\*\-Exposes various functions to the other modules }{\pageref{classNetwork}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structRequest}{\-Request} \\*\-The data structure that the generator threads send to the timekeeper as a request via the message queue }{\pageref{structRequest}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structWakeUp}{\-Wake\-Up} \\*\-The data structure that the timekeeper sends to the generator as a wake up call via the message queue }{\pageref{structWakeUp}}{}
\end{DoxyCompactList}
